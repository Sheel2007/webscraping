# MachineLearning
This is a repository of all my machine learning projects.

All these projects can be run in either a notebook (google colab or jupyter notebook) or a virtual environment.

The projects each have a corresponding dataset attached in the datasets folder. 

All the datasets have been downloaded from kaggle and are NOT created by me, I only downloaded and used them.

Feel free to download any and all of these projects.
